# ðŸ’Š Personalized-Medicine-Recommendation-System

## Description:

This repository contains the code for a personalized medicine recommendation system. The system is designed to help healthcare providers recommend personalized treatment plans for their patients based on the limited information from the csv file. 

Here We take symptoms from users and recommend medicines registered in the CSV. Here we used `count vectorization` and `bag of words` technique to recommend.
I have created a `tinkter` model to deploy this system which also speakes the name of the medicines using `pyttsx3` library.
